# Survey form with React

The assignment was to build a survey using react, state and components with different input-types. I choose text, select, radio and range.

## The problem
First I followed instructions for the stepcounter connected to a button in the app.js and then I followed instructions for the first question-component. After that I made a component for every question+summary based on that first component. But with some tweeks for the different input-types. 
I lated connected the different components to each step of the counter.
